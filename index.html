                    I was born in Seattle Washington, before moving to Colorado Springs at the age of three. Myself, my little brother, and older sister grew up in a small town east of the Springs called Peyton. At one point, we had 9 dogs and somewhere in the ballpark of 18 cats. Between a house full of pets, and religious dedication to afterschool sports, there was never a dull moment. I graduated from a larger high school to the west, Falcon High. After graduating 11th in my class, I attended Colorado Mesa University on a full ride academic scholarship where I studied Business Management and Economics. I ran for the varsity cross country team for 4, and the varsity track team for 2 years. After that, I spent some time teaching mathematics at Denver West Leadership Academy, before working for an NGO that took me overseas to Thailand and Cambodia where i'd lived, and taught for about 3 years. I met my wife in Siem Reap, Cambodia, and a year after our wedding in 2018, she immigrated with me back to the states. We now live and work in Loveland Colorado, and are currently expecting our first baby this summer! I've done a bit of independent coding study, and enjoy every minute I spend doing it. This bootcamp is my first serious investement in developing this skill.

                    When i'm not coding, I enjoy just about anything outdoors. I've knocked out 21, 14k peaks in North America, including Californias Mt. Whitney, and Colorado's Crestone Peak, Traverse, and Needle. I start most days with a morning run, and recently PR'd this fall with a half marathon time of 1:24:20. During the summer, I spend as much time as I can fly fishing, and camping. An equal amount of time is dedicated to a single speed bicycle I recently rebuilt. Trout are my favorite fish to catch, although I've also pulled in a few bluegill with my wife. I recently picked up hunting, my stepfathers greatest passion, and brought in my first duck, and foxsquirrel a few months ago. Other interests include reading, trying new breweries (I'll drink stouts and porters all year), swimming, and football (which we mistakenly refer to as soccer in this country. I will never know why.) After the pandemic, I aspire to get back to traveling a bit as well!

                    The majority of my work history has been teaching, although I've done all kinds of jobs prior ranging from pesticide application in South Dakota's black hills, to moving and driving for 2 Men and a Truck, to tutoring statistics at University. After discoving travel, and the lessons it offered, I identified teaching as a practical way to work while living overseas. Not to mention, teaching is fun and very challenging. and I honestly hope to do it again. Since relocating back to the states, i've spent my time working as a staffing recruiter for an employment agency in Longmont. Staffing is traditionally a way of employing the underemployed. Our agency specializes primarily in low skilled labor, although we do occasionally recruit for skilled administrative, and production work. This industry has its own challenges, but has pushed me to grow personally. I hope to move forward with a more technical position centered around the foundation I build in this class.
